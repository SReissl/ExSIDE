# ExSIDE
Files necessary to reproduce the simulations presented in "Monetary policy and prudential regulation in a hybrid 
AB-SFC model with heterogeneous expectations" (http://exside-itn.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/08-2018-WPaper-ExSIDE-all.pdf). The repository contains the model itself as well as the scripts used
to initialise it, run it and to collect the resulting simulation data.

PLEASE NOTE:
There is an updated version of this model and the companion paper which contains alternative and expanded simulation results and fixes some minor bugs present in this version! I recommend using the code available at https://github.com/SReissl/JEEC! The revised companion paper is available on request (severindavid.reissl@unicatt.it)
